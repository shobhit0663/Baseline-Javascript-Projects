Notes:-

Creating a full-fledged code profiler and optimizer is quite complex, and building a comprehensive tool may require server-side components and advanced algorithms. However, I can provide you with a basic example of a code profiler and optimizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This example will focus on basic syntax highlighting and character count profiling.


This example provides a basic UI for entering code, profiling its character count, and applying a simple optimization (removing extra whitespaces). For a more advanced code profiler and optimizer, you might want to explore third-party libraries and tools or consider server-side solutions for more intensive optimizations.
