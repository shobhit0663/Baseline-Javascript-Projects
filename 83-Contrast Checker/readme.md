# Notes:

Creating an advanced Contrast Checker web app involves assessing the contrast between text and background colors to ensure readability, especially for users with visual impairments. For this example, I'll use the React.js framework. Make sure to include React.js in your project, either by downloading it and adding it to your project or using a CDN.

**In this example:**

-   Users can input foreground and background colors using color pickers.
-   The contrast ratio is calculated and compared against the WCAG 2.0 AA standard (4.5:1).
-   The result is displayed, indicating whether the contrast passes or fails.

Feel free to customize the app further based on your specific requirements. This example provides a basic foundation for a Contrast Checker web app using React.js.
