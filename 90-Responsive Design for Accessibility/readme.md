# Accessibility Considerations:

-   Use semantic HTML elements (<nav>, <header>, <main>, <footer>) for better screen reader support.
-   Ensure all interactive elements have focus styles.
-   Implement ARIA roles and attributes as needed.
-   Test your web app using accessibility tools like Axe or Lighthouse.
-   Provide alternative text for images (alt attribute).
-   Ensure proper color contrast for text.
